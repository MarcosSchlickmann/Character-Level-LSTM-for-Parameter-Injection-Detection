Web application attacks are one of the main points of attack against web servers. With the increase in exchange of information through the web, attackers find new ways to compromise the security of the web and their users. HTTP is an application layer stateless protocol that is widely used for communication between web browsers and we servers. Attackers often inject malicious codes into the parameters of the HTTP requests to execute their attacks against web servers. An automated approach for detecting web application attacks will be proposed. By using the concept of Long Short-Term Memory, HTTP request packets will be inspected and analyzed for anomaly detection.
